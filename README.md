# CommandHookPaper
Entity selector parsing for non-vanilla commands.

Only compatible with Paper servers from **1.21.3** to **1.21.4**.

This plugin acts as a simple replacement for [CommandHook](https://github.com/NewAgeCZ/CommandHook),
which does not work anymore in 1.21.3+. Therefore, the vast majority of the code was made by its author.
